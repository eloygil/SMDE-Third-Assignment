The file Report.pdf has a summary of our experiments during this assignment.

Our script Simulator.R has all we need: The first part is meant to be used to check 
the effects of service times following a long-tailed distribution. It is easy to use
those lines to calculate the mean, variance, standard deviation and the coefficient 
of variation.

It is possible to check the effect of long tailed service times on G/G/1, using the
assigned distribution and parameters prints the traffic factor and scale variable b. 
This is used to compare the theoretical values with the simulation performed with
the Java simulator available in the Raco and also stores the b values to run our own
simulation.

The last part of the script runs a proper simulation of the queueing system: The
assigned parameters are already set but are commented to easily modify them if it is
necessary, we only need to set the value of b by setting the index in Line 101 and
run the code. It will take a while but this will show the mean time in the system,
mean time in the queue, average system occupation and average queue occupation with
their corresponding standard deviation. Also, plots are generate to represent the
evolution of LT along the time.
